# Hacker_News_App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Running Locally

Navigate to the directory below this one, Hacker-News-App and run:
 
> dotnet run

This will kick off the dotnet app, and tell you which port on localhost it's running (should be 5001)

## Testing

Note: This was my first time to really work in Angular, and to use Karma/Jasmine for testing. I strugged to get providers working, so these tests will fail... That being said, I am looking forward to learning more about this tech, and with more time, I have no doubt I can master this testing.

Navigate to Hacker-News-App/ClientApp and run:

> npm run ng test

This will run the tests created.
